### Automaton
- This is one the core projects under the umbrella touchstone
- The project's design philosophy is based on:
  + building a DSL over execution of commands
  + commands are the ones that can be executed from a terminal
    + e.g. cli based commands
  + commands can be executed remotely
    + e.g. ssh based commands
  + rest based commands
