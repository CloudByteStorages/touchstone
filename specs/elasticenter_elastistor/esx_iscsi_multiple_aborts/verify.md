# verify
- lock contention between 2 threads when one trying to terminate & other trying to process
- if a blocking IO is present, no future IOs can be processed till blocking IO is processed
- all subsequent IOs can get timed-out in client side & client can keep sending ABORT for all IOs
- exited thread did not clear the IOs in its queue
- multiple connections to a single iscsi LUN
- stats of blocking IO & non-blocking IO
- stats of queue
- stats of queue & its owning thread
- stats of no. of threads/connections to a LUN
- lock was considered invalid & exited considering it as fatal
- check if enough time is given to clear the IOs before terminating the locks for the connection
- check if locks are removed only after all inflight IOs related to the connection is drained from the kernel/disk queues.
- the thread processing the IO should not quit
- Check for lock error:22 in the VSM /var/log/messages
